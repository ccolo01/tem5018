# Section 4: Programmable Microcontrollers — Real-World Problem Solving

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    This section will be available before Session 4. It will cover:
    
    - Introduction to microcontrollers (micro:bit, CodeBug, Arduino)
    - Input-process-output: making the invisible visible
    - Block-based programming environments (MakeCode, Scratch extensions)
    - Sensors and actuators: connecting to the physical world
    - Project-based learning: from idea to prototype
    - Cross-curricular links: science, design & technology, environmental studies
    - Age-appropriate progression
    - Example lessons and activities
