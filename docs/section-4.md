## 4.1 Introduction: From Screens to Hands

In the previous section, we explored floor robots—devices that children program through button presses or screen-based apps. This section takes us deeper into the world of **tangible interfaces**: tools that allow children to create programs by physically manipulating objects rather than interacting with screens.

Why does this matter? Consider a typical scene in a primary classroom: a child sits at a tablet, tapping icons to create a sequence. Now imagine a different scene: three children gathered around a table, arranging coloured wooden blocks, debating which piece should come next, physically moving and rearranging their "code" before sending it to a robot. Both children are learning to program, but the second scenario offers something qualitatively different—embodied, collaborative, and tactile engagement with computational thinking.

Research by Horn and colleagues at the Boston Museum of Science found that visitors were significantly more likely to engage with a tangible programming interface than an equivalent graphical one, spent longer interacting with it, and—crucially—children were more likely to become actively involved when using tangible blocks rather than on-screen equivalents (Horn et al., 2009). This finding aligns with what developmental psychologists have long understood: young children learn best through direct manipulation of physical objects.

!!! quote "From the Research"
    "Tangible user interfaces are concerned with providing tangible representations to digital information and controls, allowing users to quite literally grasp data with their hands and effect functionality by physical manipulations of these representations."
    
    — Shaer & Hornecker (2010)

For primary teachers, tangible interfaces offer practical advantages beyond pedagogy. They often require no screens, reducing concerns about screen time. They naturally support collaborative work, as multiple children can manipulate the same physical materials simultaneously. And they provide a bridge between the abstract world of programming and the concrete, manipulable world that young children inhabit.

## 4.2 The Pedagogical Case for Tangible Programming

Before examining specific tools, let's understand why tangible interfaces are particularly powerful for young learners.

### Embodied Cognition in Action

As we discussed in Section 1, cognitive science increasingly recognises that thinking is not confined to the brain—we think with our bodies, through gesture, movement, and manipulation. When children arrange physical coding blocks, they are not merely inputting commands; they are *thinking through their hands*.

Research on tangible user interfaces (TUIs) in education has identified several key advantages (Liang et al., 2021):

1. **Novice-friendly**: Physical objects provide immediate, intuitive feedback. A block that won't fit signals an error before any code runs.

2. **Cognitive support**: Arranging physical objects reduces cognitive load. Children can see their entire program laid out spatially, making it easier to reason about sequence and identify errors.

3. **Promotes initiative**: Children can experiment freely, rearranging blocks without fear of "breaking" anything. There is no wrong way to pick up a block.

4. **Encourages collaboration**: When code is physical, multiple children can contribute simultaneously. There's no single keyboard or mouse to fight over.

5. **Authentic context**: Physical programming feels like building or creating, aligning with children's natural play patterns.

### Beyond "Screen-Free"

It would be easy to reduce the value of tangible interfaces to "less screen time"—and while reduced screen exposure is a genuine benefit for young children, the pedagogical advantages run deeper. Tangible programming changes the *social dynamics* of learning.

Horn et al. (2009) observed that with tangible interfaces, group programming became more egalitarian: rather than one child controlling a mouse while others watched, multiple children could physically contribute to building a program. This has particular implications for gender equity in computing education, as the same research found that girls were significantly more likely to take an active role when using tangible rather than graphical interfaces.

## 4.3 Categories of Tangible Programming Tools

Tangible programming tools for primary education come in several forms. Understanding these categories will help you choose appropriate tools for your learning objectives.

### 4.3.1 Button-Based Robots

The simplest form of tangible programming, these robots are programmed through physical buttons on the robot itself.

**Examples**: Bee-Bot, Blue-Bot (on-device programming), Botley

**How they work**: Children press directional buttons in sequence, building up a program stored in the robot's memory. When they press "Go," the robot executes the sequence.

**Key characteristics**:

- No external components required
- Highly intuitive for very young children (ages 4-6)
- Limited program complexity
- Sequential only—no visual representation of the full program

**When to use**: First introduction to programming concepts, whole-class demonstrations, early years settings.

### 4.3.2 Tile/Block-Based Systems

These systems use physical tiles or blocks that children arrange to create programs. The arrangement is then read by a device (robot, reader, or scanner).

**Examples**: 

- **[Cubetto](https://primotoys.com/)** (Primo Toys): Wooden robot with coloured coding blocks that slot into a control board. Forward, left, right, backward, and function blocks create sequences for the wooden robot to execute. Designed for ages 3+ with no screen required.

- **[KUBO](https://kubo-robot.com/)**: Uses TagTile® puzzle-piece blocks that the robot drives over to "read" the program. Tiles snap together like jigsaw pieces. Covers sequences, functions, subroutines, and loops.

- **[Scottie Go!](https://scottiego.com/en/)**: Cardboard tiles that children arrange on a surface, then scan with a tablet camera. An app interprets the tile arrangement and animates a character following the program. Combines tangible manipulation with screen-based feedback.

- **Blue-Bot TacTile Reader** (TTS): Physical tiles placed in a reader that transmits programs to Blue-Bot via Bluetooth. Up to three readers can be connected for longer programs (up to 30 steps).

**Key characteristics**:

- Visual representation of full program before execution
- Supports debugging through physical rearrangement
- Varying levels of complexity (simple sequences to loops and conditionals)
- Some require companion devices; others are fully screen-free

**When to use**: Developing debugging skills, introducing loops and functions, collaborative programming activities.

### 4.3.3 Hybrid Tangible-Digital Systems

These systems combine physical manipulatives with screen-based feedback, using cameras or sensors to bridge the physical and digital worlds.

**Examples**:

- **[Osmo Coding](https://www.playosmo.com/)**: Uses magnetic coding blocks that children arrange in front of an iPad. The device's camera (with a reflector attachment) recognises the block arrangement and controls an on-screen character. Games include Coding Awbie (basic sequencing), Coding Jam (music and loops), and Coding Duo (collaborative puzzles).

- **Scottie Go!**: As mentioned above, uses augmented reality to connect physical tiles with digital animation.

**Key characteristics**:

- Rich visual and audio feedback
- Engaging game-like experiences
- Requires tablet or compatible device
- Bridges physical manipulation with digital outcomes

**When to use**: Engaging reluctant learners, adding game elements to programming, connecting coding with digital creativity.

### 4.3.4 Creative/Invention Interfaces

These tools allow children to create their own interfaces and controllers, extending computing into physical making.

**Example**: 

- **[Makey Makey](https://makeymakey.com/)**: A circuit board that connects everyday objects to a computer. Any conductive material (fruit, playdough, foil, pencil graphite, even people!) can become a keyboard key or mouse click. Originally developed at MIT Media Lab.

**Key characteristics**:

- Open-ended creativity
- Connects coding with science (conductivity, circuits)
- Works with any software that accepts keyboard input
- Encourages invention and physical making

**When to use**: Cross-curricular projects, invention challenges, connecting computing with science and art.

## 4.4 Choosing the Right Interface

With so many options available, how do you choose? Consider these factors:

### Age and Developmental Stage

| Age Group | Recommended Interfaces | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------|
| 3-5 years | Cubetto, Bee-Bot, Botley | Completely screen-free, minimal buttons, large manipulables |
| 5-7 years | KUBO, Blue-Bot with TacTile, Cubetto | Tile-based systems introduce visual program representation |
| 7-9 years | Scottie Go!, Osmo Coding, Makey Makey | Hybrid systems add complexity; creative tools support open-ended projects |
| 9-11 years | Makey Makey + Scratch, advanced tile systems | Ready for combining tangible input with on-screen programming |

### Learning Objectives

**If you want to develop...**

- **Sequencing**: Any tile-based system that shows the full program
- **Debugging**: TacTile Reader (errors visible in physical arrangement), KUBO
- **Loops and repetition**: Cubetto (function blocks), KUBO Coding+, Scottie Go!
- **Collaboration**: Large tile systems where multiple children can contribute
- **Creativity**: Makey Makey for invention, Osmo for game-like engagement
- **Cross-curricular connections**: Makey Makey (science), Scottie Go! (geography, storytelling)

### Practical Constraints

| Factor | Questions to Consider |
|--------|----------------------|
| Budget | How many units needed? Cost per child? |
| Screen policy | Does your school have screen-time limits? |
| Space | Room for floor work? Table space for tiles? |
| Charging | Battery life? Charging infrastructure? |
| Durability | How robust are components? Suitable for young children? |
| Storage | Where will tiles/blocks be kept? Easy to organise? |

## 4.5 Supporting Diverse Learners

One of the most significant advantages of tangible interfaces is their accessibility for learners with diverse needs.

### Visual Learners

Tile-based systems allow children to see their entire program laid out spatially before execution. This visual representation supports planning and debugging in ways that sequential button-pressing cannot.

### Kinaesthetic Learners

For children who learn best through movement and touch, tangible programming is transformative. Rather than sitting still and tapping a screen, they can walk around a table, pick up blocks, feel different textures, and physically build their programs.

### Children with Fine Motor Challenges

Many tangible interfaces use large, easy-to-grasp components. Cubetto's wooden blocks, KUBO's TagTiles, and TacTile Reader tiles are all designed for small hands. This can be more accessible than precise screen tapping or mouse control.

### English as an Additional Language (EAL)

Tangible systems often use icons rather than text, reducing language barriers. A forward arrow means forward regardless of the child's first language. Physical demonstration is also easier than verbal explanation.

### Children with Attention Difficulties

The multi-sensory, hands-on nature of tangible programming can help maintain engagement. The lack of on-screen distractions (notifications, other apps) creates a more focused environment.

### Collaborative Learning Needs

For children who benefit from peer support, tangible interfaces naturally enable collaboration. More confident children can model block placement while others contribute ideas. The physical nature makes peer scaffolding visible and immediate.

!!! tip "Practical Consideration"
    When working with children who have specific access needs, consult with your school's inclusion coordinator. Some children may need adapted equipment (larger blocks, contrasting colours) or modified activities. The tangible nature of these tools often makes adaptation easier than with screen-based alternatives.

---

## 4.6 Cross-Curricular Applications

Tangible programming tools lend themselves particularly well to cross-curricular integration because the physical nature invites connections with other hands-on subjects.

### Mathematics

**Cubetto and KUBO**:

- **Measurement**: How far does the robot travel with one forward command? Children can measure in non-standard units (blocks, hand spans) or standard units.
- **Geometry**: Program turns and explore angles. How many 90-degree turns make a full circle?
- **Position and direction**: Use correct mathematical vocabulary—quarter turn, half turn, clockwise, anticlockwise.

**Makey Makey**:

- **Data handling**: Create physical buttons for survey responses; data is collected as children press their chosen answer.
- **Calculation games**: Build a physical number line or calculator interface.

### Literacy

**Scottie Go!**:

- Create animated stories by programming character movements through narrative sequences.
- Retell traditional tales: program Red Riding Hood's path through the forest.

**Blue-Bot TacTile**:

- Sequence story events physically with tiles, then watch Blue-Bot "act out" the sequence.
- Build instruction writing: children write their own TacTile guides for classmates.

### Science

**Makey Makey**:

- **Electricity and circuits**: Understand that Makey Makey completes a circuit through conductive materials.
- **Properties of materials**: Test which objects are conductive (Can you use an apple as a button? A carrot? A wooden spoon?).
- **Living things**: Create interactive nature displays (touch a leaf picture to hear its name).

**KUBO and Cubetto**:

- Program animal movements: How does a bee navigate from flower to flower?
- Model food chains: Program the robot to follow the energy flow.

### Geography

**Floor robots with tangible programming**:

- Navigate map mats of local areas, countries, or continents.
- Plan routes and estimate distances.
- Learn compass directions through programming.

### Art and Design

**Makey Makey + Scratch**:

- Create interactive artwork: paintings that make sounds when touched.
- Build musical instruments from recycled materials.
- Design game controllers using clay, playdough, or found objects.

## 4.8 Classroom Management for Tangible Tools

Tangible programming brings unique classroom management considerations.

### Organisation and Storage

**The challenge**: Many small pieces that can easily go missing.

**Solutions**:

- Designated storage boxes with labelled compartments
- Photograph the complete set and display near storage
- Regular inventory checks (can be a child's responsibility)
- Consider tile organisers or sorting trays for session use
- Velcro or magnetic storage boards for quick tidying

### Turn-Taking and Collaboration

**The challenge**: Multiple children wanting to place blocks simultaneously.

**Solutions**:

- Assign roles (planner, builder, tester, recorder)
- Use a physical "talking piece"—only the child holding it places the next tile
- Colour-code tiles to children (each child places their colour)
- Pair programming: one describes, one places

### Space Requirements

**The challenge**: Floor robots need floor space; tile systems need table space.

**Solutions**:

- Create a dedicated "programming zone" in your classroom
- Use outdoor spaces for larger floor robot activities
- Vertical displays for planning (magnetic boards for tile arrangement before transfer)
- Rotate groups through programming stations

### Technical Issues

**The challenge**: Connectivity problems, flat batteries, lost components.

**Solutions**:

- Establish charging routines (end of day, specific child responsibility)
- Keep backup batteries and charging cables accessible
- Have a "parking bay" for robots with issues—don't stop the whole lesson
- Laminated troubleshooting cards for common problems

## 4.10 Summary

Tangible programming interfaces represent a powerful approach to computational thinking education in primary schools. By translating abstract programming concepts into physical manipulation, they align with how young children naturally learn—through hands, not just heads.

**Key takeaways from this section**:

1. **Tangible interfaces offer genuine pedagogical advantages**—not just "less screen time" but fundamentally different learning dynamics that support collaboration, reduce cognitive load, and encourage active participation from all learners.

2. **Different tools suit different purposes**: Button-based robots for first introductions; tile systems for developing debugging and visual programming skills; hybrid systems for engagement and game-like learning; creative tools like Makey Makey for invention and cross-curricular connections.

3. **Accessibility is a key strength**: The physical nature of tangible programming often makes it more accessible for diverse learners than screen-based alternatives.

4. **Cross-curricular integration is natural**: The hands-on, physical nature of these tools invites connections with mathematics, science, literacy, geography, and art.

5. **Practical considerations matter**: Storage, organisation, space, and technical management all require planning—but the learning benefits justify the investment.

As you explore tangible interfaces with your class, remember that the goal is not mastery of any particular tool, but the development of computational thinking habits: breaking problems into steps, representing solutions symbolically, debugging through systematic analysis, and recognising patterns that can be abstracted and reused. Tangible tools simply make these abstract skills visible, touchable, and—for young learners—truly graspable.
