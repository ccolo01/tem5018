## 5.1 Introduction: The Power of the Unplugged

Throughout this reader, we have explored programmable robots, tangible interfaces, and microcontrollers—tools that bridge the gap between physical and digital worlds. In this section, we take a different approach: **mechanical logic toys** that teach computational thinking without any electronics at all.

Why step away from screens and circuits? Consider these scenarios:

- A rural school with limited internet connectivity and outdated computers
- A classroom where device-sharing means some children wait while others work
- A home environment where parents prefer screen-free learning activities
- A lesson where you want children to focus purely on thinking, without the distraction of debugging software issues

In all these cases, mechanical logic toys offer a powerful alternative. They strip away the layers of technology that can obscure the fundamental ideas of computing, allowing children to see—quite literally—how logical systems work.

!!! quote "From the Research"
    "Unplugged activities as a low-cost solution to foster computational thinking skills seem to be a trend in recent years... CT education has several benefits and offers superior features, such as low cost, independence of the use of computers, no need for teacher's ICT skills, and ease of implementation."
    
    — Huang & Looi (2023)

Research consistently supports the value of unplugged approaches. A meta-analysis of 49 studies found that unplugged activities have a large overall effect on computational thinking skills (Hedges's g = 1.028), with particularly strong benefits for primary school students (Huang & Looi, 2023). Crucially, studies show that combining unplugged activities with later computer-based work leads to better outcomes than screen-only approaches (Bell & Vahrenhold, 2018).

## 5.2 The Pedagogical Case for Unplugged Learning

### Why Not Just Use Computers?

When children program on a computer, several things happen simultaneously: they must navigate the interface, manage syntax and commands, deal with error messages, and think about the underlying logic. For beginners, this cognitive load can be overwhelming. The computer itself becomes an obstacle to understanding.

Mechanical logic toys remove these barriers. When a child builds a marble run that sorts colours, or arranges puzzle pieces to guide a ball to a target, the logic is visible and tangible. There are no error messages—just immediate, physical feedback. Either the marble goes where intended, or it doesn't.

### Benefits of Unplugged Approaches

**Accessibility**: No computers, internet, or electricity required. Every child can participate equally regardless of their home technology access.

**Focus on thinking**: Without software to wrestle with, children concentrate on the problem-solving itself—decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design.

**Immediate feedback**: Physical systems provide instant, unambiguous results. Children see immediately whether their solution works.

**Collaboration**: Unlike screen-based activities where one person typically controls the device, physical puzzles naturally invite discussion, joint problem-solving, and turn-taking.

**Reduced anxiety**: Some children (and teachers) feel intimidated by computers. Mechanical toys feel familiar, playful, and non-threatening.

**Durability**: No batteries to charge, no software updates, no compatibility issues. These tools work reliably, year after year.

### The Unplugged-Plugged Connection

Research suggests that unplugged activities work best when combined with screen-based programming, not as a replacement for it. The ideal sequence is:

1. **Introduce concepts unplugged**: Children explore ideas like sequencing, conditionals, or binary through hands-on activities
2. **Transfer to digital**: Children recognise the same concepts when they appear in programming environments
3. **Deepen understanding**: Moving between unplugged and plugged activities reinforces learning through multiple representations

This approach aligns with pedagogical models like PRIMM (Predict-Run-Investigate-Modify-Make) and Use-Modify-Create, where understanding precedes creation (Sentance et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2011).

## 5.3 Turing Tumble: The Marble-Powered Computer

### What Is Turing Tumble?

**[Turing Tumble](https://www.turingtumble.com/)** is a game where players build mechanical computers powered by marbles to solve logic puzzles. Created by Paul and Alyssa Boswell (a former professor and high school teacher), it was funded through a remarkably successful Kickstarter campaign and has since won multiple awards including the Parents' Choice Gold Award.

Named after computing pioneer Alan Turing, the game makes an extraordinary claim: the logic system it uses is **Turing complete**, meaning that given a large enough board, it could theoretically perform any computation a regular computer can do.

### How It Works

The Turing Tumble consists of:

- A white board with pins for attaching pieces
- Two marble reservoirs (blue and red marbles)
- Six types of components:
  - **Ramps** (green): Direct marbles left or right
  - **Crossovers** (orange): Allow marbles to pass through from either direction
  - **Bits** (blue and red): Flip-flop switches that alternate direction
  - **Interceptors**: Stop marbles at specific points
  - **Gear bits**: Bits connected by gears so they interact
  - **Gears**: Connect multiple gear bits

When a marble drops from the top, it follows the path determined by the arrangement of pieces. Each piece it passes may change state (bits flip) or trigger other actions. By arranging pieces cleverly, players can create systems that count in binary, add numbers, generate patterns, and much more.

### Computational Concepts Taught

| Concept | How Turing Tumble Demonstrates It |
|---------|-----------------------------------|
| **Binary numbers** | Bits represent 1s and 0s; counting in binary becomes visible |
| **Logic gates** | Gear bits create AND, OR, and other logical operations |
| **Conditionals** | "If the bit is pointing left, then the marble goes left" |
| **Loops** | Marble release triggers next marble, creating repetition |
| **State** | The position of bits represents stored information |
| **Algorithms** | Each puzzle requires designing a sequence of operations |

### Using Turing Tumble in the Classroom

**Age range**: 8 to adult (officially), though younger children can engage with simpler challenges with support.

**Setting**: Works well for individual puzzle-solving, pairs, or small groups discussing strategies together.

**Curriculum links**:

- **Computing**: Binary numbers, logic, algorithms, how computers work
- **Mathematics**: Place value, counting systems, addition/subtraction operations
- **Science**: Cause and effect, systems thinking
- **D&T**: Mechanism design, problem-solving

**Practical tips**:

- Start with the included comic book story, which introduces components gradually through a narrative
- The first 20 puzzles focus on basic mechanics; binary concepts begin around puzzle 21
- Allow plenty of time—some puzzles take significant experimentation
- Encourage children to verbalise their thinking: "I think if I put a bit here, then..."
- Consider having multiple boards so children can work at their own pace

## 5.4 Gravity Maze and Spatial Reasoning Puzzles

### ThinkFun Gravity Maze

**[Gravity Maze](https://www.thinkfun.com/)** (by ThinkFun/Ravensburger) is a marble run logic game that develops spatial reasoning and planning skills. Unlike Turing Tumble, it doesn't simulate computation directly, but it teaches fundamental problem-solving skills that underpin computational thinking.

**How it works**:

- Players receive challenge cards showing a starting tower configuration and a target position
- Using the available tower pieces, they must build a path for the marble to travel from start to target
- The towers are transparent, allowing players to visualise the internal path
- 60 challenges progress from beginner to expert difficulty

**Skills developed**:

- Spatial reasoning and visualisation
- Planning and sequencing
- Trial and error / debugging
- Persistence and resilience

### Other ThinkFun Logic Puzzles

ThinkFun (now part of Ravensburger) produces a range of single-player logic puzzles suitable for primary classrooms:

| Puzzle | Age | Key Skills |
|--------|-----|------------|
| **Rush Hour** | 8+ | Sequential planning, working backwards |
| **Laser Maze** | 8+ | Angles, reflection, path planning |
| **Circuit Maze** | 8+ | Electrical circuits, logical connections |
| **Robot Turtles** (board game) | 4+ | Sequencing, early programming concepts |
| **Code Master** | 8+ | Programming logic without a computer |

### Why Spatial Reasoning Matters

Spatial reasoning—the ability to visualise and manipulate objects mentally—is strongly correlated with success in STEM fields. It's also a skill that can be improved through practice. Logic puzzles like Gravity Maze provide deliberate practice in spatial thinking, building foundations that support later work with coordinates, geometry, and programming.

## 5.5 Other Mechanical Logic Toys

### Marble Runs and Construction Sets

Traditional marble runs (such as those by Hubelino, Quadrilla, or GraviTrax) aren't specifically designed for computing education, but they teach valuable related skills:

- Cause and effect relationships
- Sequential thinking ("first the marble goes here, then...")
- Trial and error debugging
- Engineering and construction

**GraviTrax** is particularly notable for its expansion sets that introduce specific physics concepts (magnetism, catapults, etc.) and its app integration for additional challenges.

### Logic Board Games

Several board games explicitly teach computational thinking concepts:

**CODE (from ThinkFun)**: A series of games including "On the Brink," "Rover Control," and "Robot Repair" that teach programming logic through card-based gameplay.

**Cody's Rules**: A card game where players create and follow algorithms using rule cards.

**Hello Ruby**: Based on Linda Liukas's book series, includes activity sets for unplugged coding adventures.

### Puzzle Books and Card Games

Don't overlook low-tech options:

- **Logic puzzle books**: Grid puzzles, sudoku (simplified for younger children), and deduction games
- **CS Unplugged cards**: Downloadable activities using standard playing cards or printed materials
- **Bebras Challenge**: Annual computational thinking challenge with many unplugged-style problems

## 5.6 Computational Concepts Through Unplugged Activities

### Binary Numbers

Binary—the base-2 number system using only 0s and 1s—underlies all digital computing. Unplugged activities make this abstract concept tangible:

**Binary cards activity** (CS Unplugged):

- Five cards show 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 dots
- Children flip cards face-up or face-down to represent numbers
- Making the number 19? That's 16 + 2 + 1, so cards showing 16, 2, and 1 are face-up
- Turing Tumble extends this with physical bits that flip to represent binary states

**Why it matters**: Understanding binary helps children grasp how computers store all information—text, images, sounds—as patterns of 1s and 0s.

### Logic Gates

Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits. They take inputs and produce outputs based on simple rules:

| Gate | Rule | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| AND | Output is 1 only if ALL inputs are 1 | Both switches must be on to light the bulb |
| OR | Output is 1 if ANY input is 1 | Either switch can light the bulb |
| NOT | Output is the opposite of input | Switch off turns light on, and vice versa |

**Unplugged activities**:

- "Human logic gates": Children act as gates, responding to raised/lowered hands
- Turing Tumble gear bits demonstrate AND/OR behaviour physically
- Simple circuit diagrams with switches children can trace

### Conditionals (Selection)

Conditionals—"if this, then that"—are fundamental to programming. Mechanical toys demonstrate this naturally:

- **Turing Tumble bit**: "If the bit points left, the marble goes left; otherwise, it goes right"
- **Gravity Maze towers**: "If I place this tower here, then the marble will exit at this level"
- **Rush Hour**: "If I move this car first, then I can move the truck"

Children using these toys constantly apply conditional reasoning, even without formal instruction.

### Algorithms and Debugging

Every puzzle solution is essentially an algorithm—a sequence of steps to achieve a goal. When the solution doesn't work:

1. Observe the actual behaviour
2. Compare to expected behaviour
3. Identify where they diverge
4. Hypothesise about the cause
5. Modify and test again

This debugging process is identical whether children are fixing a Turing Tumble configuration or debugging Python code.

## 5.8 Cross-Curricular Connections

### Mathematics

**Number systems**: Binary provides a concrete example of place value in a different base. Compare with decimal: just as 234 means (2 × 100) + (3 × 10) + (4 × 1), the binary number 1011 means (1 × 8) + (0 × 4) + (1 × 2) + (1 × 1) = 11.

**Logic and reasoning**: Puzzle-solving develops logical deduction—skills directly applicable to mathematical proof and problem-solving.

**Addition and subtraction**: Turing Tumble's binary counter literally adds and subtracts, making arithmetic operations visible as physical processes.

### Science

**Systems and processes**: Marble runs demonstrate input-process-output systems. Change one component, observe the effect on the whole.

**Forces and motion**: Gravity powers these toys—connect to lessons on forces, motion, and energy transfer.

**Cause and effect**: Every puzzle reinforces scientific thinking about causation.

### Design & Technology

**Mechanisms**: Gears, levers, ramps—mechanical logic toys involve the same mechanisms studied in D&T.

**Iterative design**: The puzzle-solving process models engineering design: try, test, evaluate, improve.

**Problem specification**: Each puzzle presents a clear design brief with constraints and success criteria.

### English

**Instructional writing**: After solving a puzzle, children write instructions for others to follow.

**Explanation texts**: Describe how a mechanism works, using appropriate technical vocabulary.

**Reasoning and justification**: Explain why a solution works, defending design choices.

## 5.9 Example Activities

### Activity 1: Binary Birthday Numbers (Years 3-4)

**Learning objective**: Represent numbers in binary using physical objects.

**Resources**: Five large cards showing 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 dots (or use CS Unplugged printables); number cards 0-31.

**Activity**:

1. Introduce the five binary cards. Explain that computers only use two digits: 0 and 1.
2. Demonstrate: "Face-up means 1, face-down means 0. To make a number, add the values of face-up cards."
3. Challenge: "What's your age? Can you make it with these cards?"
4. Children work in pairs to represent different numbers.
5. Extension: "What's the largest number you can make? The smallest? How many different numbers are possible?"

**Assessment**: Can children reliably convert between decimal and 5-bit binary?

### Activity 2: Gravity Maze Challenge Stations (Years 4-6)

**Learning objective**: Develop spatial reasoning and systematic problem-solving strategies.

**Resources**: Multiple Gravity Maze sets (or rotate through one); challenge cards sorted by difficulty.

**Activity**:

1. Set up 4-5 stations around the room, each with a Gravity Maze at different difficulty levels.
2. Children rotate through stations in pairs, attempting one challenge at each.
3. Provide "strategy cards" prompting useful questions:
   - "Where does the marble need to go?"
   - "What's the most direct path?"
   - "Which tower piece would help here?"
4. Pairs record their strategies and any "stuck points" in learning journals.
5. Conclude with whole-class discussion: "What strategies helped you solve puzzles?"

**Assessment**: Observe problem-solving approaches; review learning journal reflections.

### Activity 3: Turing Tumble Computer Building (Years 5-6)

**Learning objective**: Understand how simple switches can perform computation.

**Resources**: Turing Tumble set; puzzle book; optional: video introduction.

**Activity**:

1. Show a completed Turing Tumble setup. Release marbles and observe.
2. Ask: "What do you notice? What do you wonder?"
3. Introduce components one at a time (ramps, crossovers, bits) with mini-challenges.
4. Pairs work through early puzzles (1-10), recording solutions.
5. When ready, introduce the binary counter concept (puzzles 21+).

2. Show a simple AND gate scenario (two buttons, both must be pressed).
3. Children test different input combinations and complete truth tables.
4. Repeat with OR gate (either button works) and NOT gate (press to turn off).
5. Challenge: Combine gates to create more complex rules.
6. Connection: Show how gear bits in Turing Tumble create similar logic.

**Assessment**: Complete truth tables accurately; explain gate behaviour in own words.

## 5.10 Practical Considerations

### Building a Collection

Start small and expand based on what works:

| Priority | Item | Approximate Cost | Use |
|----------|------|------------------|-----|
| Essential | CS Unplugged materials | Free (printable) | Whole-class activities |
| High | Turing Tumble (1-2 sets) | £50-60 each | Small group rotation |
| High | Gravity Maze (2-3 sets) | £25-30 each | Logic puzzle stations |
| Medium | Rush Hour | £20-25 | Independent challenge |
| Medium | Code Master | £20-25 | Programming logic |
| Optional | GraviTrax starter set | £40-50 | Open-ended construction |

### Storage and Organisation

- Store Turing Tumble pieces in compartmented boxes—losing pieces significantly impacts usability
- Keep challenge cards with each puzzle set
- Create a "puzzle library" where children can self-select activities during choosing time
- Photograph solved puzzles before tidying away (children love seeing their achievements)

### Managing Multiple Activities

Consider a "puzzle rotation" model:

- Multiple puzzle types available simultaneously
- Children work in pairs or small groups
- Rotate after fixed time (15-20 minutes)
- Teacher circulates, asking probing questions rather than giving answers

### Assessment Without Screens

- **Observation**: Watch problem-solving processes, not just outcomes
- **Verbalisation**: Ask children to explain their thinking
- **Learning journals**: Children sketch solutions and reflect on strategies
- **Challenge progression**: Track which puzzle levels each child completes
- **Transfer tasks**: Can children apply strategies to new, unfamiliar puzzles?

## 5.12 Summary

Mechanical logic toys offer a unique and powerful approach to teaching computational thinking. By stripping away screens, software, and syntax, they allow children to engage directly with the fundamental ideas that underpin computing.

**Key takeaways from this section**:

1. **Unplugged doesn't mean inferior**: Research shows that unplugged activities can be highly effective for developing computational thinking, particularly for primary-age children.

2. **The best approach combines both**: Use unplugged activities to introduce concepts, then transfer to screen-based programming. Each reinforces the other.

3. **Turing Tumble is genuinely computational**: Unlike general puzzle toys, Turing Tumble demonstrates actual computational principles—binary, logic gates, state—in a tangible form.

4. **Spatial reasoning supports CT**: Puzzles like Gravity Maze develop the visualisation and planning skills that underpin programming ability.

5. **Accessibility is a genuine advantage**: These tools work regardless of school technology infrastructure, home digital access, or teacher ICT confidence.

6. **The thinking is the learning**: Without troubleshooting software, children focus entirely on problem-solving—decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm design.

As you introduce mechanical logic toys in your classroom, watch how children engage with them. The focused concentration, the collaborative discussion, the satisfaction when a solution works—these are signs of deep computational thinking in action. And when those same children later encounter variables, conditionals, and loops in Scratch or Python, they'll have concrete mental models to draw upon.

---

**Preparation for Session 6**: Before the next session, try at least one unplugged activity with your class or a small group. Notice: What computational thinking skills were evident? How did children approach problems? What would you do differently next time?
