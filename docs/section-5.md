# Section 5: Mechanical Logic Toys — CT Without Electricity

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    This section will be available before Session 5. It will cover:
    
    - Logic and problem-solving through mechanical systems
    - Turing Tumble: simulating computation with marbles
    - Gravity Maze and similar spatial reasoning puzzles
    - Computational concepts: conditionals, binary, logic gates
    - Benefits: no batteries, no troubleshooting, focus on pure thinking
    - Cross-curricular links: physics, maths, engineering
    - Inclusion: accessible to learners without technology access at home
    - Example lessons and activities
