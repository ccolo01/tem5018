# Welcome to TEM5018

## Robots, Programmable Toys and Physical Computing

**A Course Reader for Primary School Teachers**

---

This reader accompanies the study-unit TEM5018 at the University of Malta. It is designed to prepare you for each synchronous session and to serve as an ongoing reference throughout your teaching practice.

!!! info "Building on TEM5016"
    This course assumes you have completed **TEM5016: Introduction to Computational Thinking**. You already understand the core CT concepts—decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking—and have experience with unplugged activities. This course takes the next step: bringing CT to life through physical computing.

## Course Assessment

Your assessment for TEM5018 consists of three components:

- **Presentation (30%)**: A 15-minute presentation on your fieldwork experience
- **Reflective Diary (30%)**: Ongoing documentation of your learning journey
- **Fieldwork (40%)**: Choose three different tools from three different sessions and try them in your school, documenting the experience with photographs and reflections
