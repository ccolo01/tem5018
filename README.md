## About This Resource

This open educational resource supports the study-unit TEM5018 at the University of Malta, part of the Postgraduate Certificate in Technology Enhanced Learning. It is designed for primary school teachers (teaching children aged 5–11) who want to bring computational thinking to life through robots, programmable toys, and physical computing.

**Prerequisites**: This reader assumes familiarity with foundational computational thinking concepts (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithmic thinking) as covered in TEM5016 or equivalent.
